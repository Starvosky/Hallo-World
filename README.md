# Hallo-World
Hello, new user here learning the ropes. 
I'm a 20 year old Thaddeus Stevens student majoring in Software Engineering. I've never done any kind of Software developing before I took this class but I've worked in automotive, service, and networking industries before I took this class. 
This was merged in. >:D
